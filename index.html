                <p>
                During my work at Netology Group there were a lot of happy moments and challenging tasks. I tried to keep up with the very dynamic development of the company, tried to do my best and helped my colleagues to become a better versions of themselves :)
                </p>
                <p>
                Here I learned a lot, and I was fortunate enough to grow up from a startup employee to a software architect/CTO in a mature and solid company (one of the biggest EduTech companies in Russia)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are some of my achievements, which I consider the most significant:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For the portals and services of the Netology, <b> business development processes have been built almost from scratch</b>, and <b>several cross-functional teams have been formed </b> that develop independent products in accordance with the principles and ideas of Agile and using the Scrum / Kanban frameworks. <b>The Department of Development of the Netology has been expanded from 4 developers to 15+</b>. There was organized independent team work with parallel software releases (Gitflow -> GithubFlow)
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    In the role of architect and developer I have developed and implemented important technical solutions and many of them are currently working in the company. Among these things:
                    <ul>

                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <b> Tools for improving SEO positions / healthchecks system </b> - custom meta tag validators and tools to build dynamic micro-markup, solutions for improving portal indexing (server rendering functionality (Dynamic nginx + PhusionPassenger (C ++) + ExpressJS backend) and AJAX-crawling proxying), optimizing page load speed (backend and frontend optimization),

                      </li>

                        <b> Sub-portals (multi-tenant apps), special projects, landing constructors (like Tilda/Webflow, but for custom needs), web editors for media content, </b>
                      </li>

          You can look at the following projects as my code examples: <br> <br> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/DavydenkovM/code_sandbox/overview">CodeSandbox</a> (Demo: <a href='https://netology.ru/netcoder'> https://netology.ru/netcoder </a>) - this is a small project in which I have participated as software architect and fullstack developer. There are SPA react/redux app, rails API backend/back-office + Code Executor written using Elixir.
          It is about 4 weeks were spent on this project (in my spare time, it is a home project). It is not the best my work (because it is part-time job), but some approaches to software development can be reviewed.

          <br> <br>

          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/DavydenkovM/sample-calendar/overview">SampleCalendar</a> - This small sample React component, written as <a href="https://github.com/notesolution/front-end-oc-task">interview assignment</a> for company <a href="https://oneclass.com">oneclass.com</a> bootstrapped with create-react-app. A couple of evenings were spent on this project

          <p>
            I'm interested in programming in the broadest sense of the word and I really like learning new things!
          </p>

          <p>
          During my career, I managed to get acquainted with different approaches to development and to do many useful things for companies in which I was fortunate enough to work. <br>
          I worked with the following languages and their ecosystems: <b> Ruby, JavaScript (ES3 / ES5 / CoffeeScript / ES2015 + / ElmLang / PureScript / nodejs), Erlang / Elixir, Scala (very little Java and Kotlin), Haskell, Go-lang, Clojure, C / C ++, Bash, Python</b>. <br> <br>

          I have an experience in the role of team lead, software architect and in the role of Head of the Development Department / CTO. I interacted quite closely with colleagues from product divisions, marketers, designers, sales departments, business representatives and partners / contractors from outside companies, so I can well imagine how to make development process effective and transparent for business. <br> <br>

          I'm sure that I could quickly adapt and be very productive in any company with a developed culture of software development.
          I have a personal development plan for the next couple of years. I quickly learn and try to keep the spirit of juniority. <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          At the moment, I'm considering the vacancy options for the keywords <b> Software Architect / Senior Fullstack / Senior Frontend / Senior Backend </b>. At the moment, I'm more interested in dealing with technical issues / software architecture than with people management.
          </p>

          <p>
          I spend free time with my family, studying electrical engineering / robotics / professional books about software engineering, studying at various online courses/master-classes. If you are interested in working with me you can walk around the links in the header of this CV - get acquainted with my presentations / speeches / take a look at various demo projects ^^ I will be happy to answer your questions :)
